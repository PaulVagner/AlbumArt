### Albutm Art 

- First use of CocoaPods

	- Used Cocoa pods in project to increase presentability and specified networking access.
	
	- Pods used: 'AFNetworking', 'SVGPlayButton
	
	- AFNetworing is used to access a specific URL or network, in this case it is Apple music library database, to obtain information about a specific Artist along with Album information (Album title, Album artwork, Album ID) as well as, all the associated tracks(Track title, Track price, Track run-time) associated with the appropriate artist 
	- SVGPlayButton is a custom button used within the application. --> Looks nice.
